# Document QA System üìö  

A robust and interactive Question-Answering system that allows users to upload documents, process them into meaningful chunks, and query for relevant information using Google Gemini AI. The system is built with **Streamlit**, **ChromaDB**, and **Google Generative AI** for a seamless user experience and efficient information retrieval.

## Features ‚ú®  
- **Document Upload**: Upload multiple text files for processing.  
- **Text Chunking**: Splits large documents into manageable chunks for better context retention.  
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate embeddings for document chunks.  
- **Query System**: Ask questions and receive concise, context-aware answers.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Store and retrieve processed document embeddings using **ChromaDB**.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.

## Key Components üß©  
1. **Document Processing**:  
   - Files are split into chunks with overlap to retain context.  
2. **Embedding Generation**:  
   - Embeddings are generated for each chunk using Google Gemini AI.  
3. **ChromaDB Integration**:  
   - Persistent storage for embedding retrieval and querying.  
4. **Query Answering**:  
   - Uses retrieved document chunks as context for answering user queries.
